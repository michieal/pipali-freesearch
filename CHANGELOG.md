- Copy, edit messages and fork conversations for more efficient workflow control.
- Get notified on your phone when Pipali finishes a task or needs approvals. Install Pipali PWA and Enable in Settings

### 🧪 Improve
- Make live chat UX more lively: Live stream each step and track time taken by each task
- Improve UX on phones: Pull to refresh, edge-to-edge display, roomier touch targets, screen awake while voice mode in listening
- Pick a model for each routine instead of always using your default
- Ensure app stays fast even with a long chat history

## 0.9.0

### 🎁 New
- Memory — Pipali now remembers things across conversations, so it will tune itself to your preferences, use-cases and environment over time. Review, delete, or turn memories entirely off from Settings → Permissions.

- Chats sync after app reconnects (e.g. when your Pipali phone progressive web app wakes from sleep)

## 0.8.0

### 🎁 New
- Voice mode — Assign tasks and provide guidance with voice, so your hands, eyes stay free. Use earbuds to step away from your desk (go cook, read, caffeinate). In Ask first mode, Pipali will chime and wait when it needs your attention. Enable voice mode via Settings/Permissions.
